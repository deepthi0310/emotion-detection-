😊 Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

📃 Project Overview

This project detects human emotions from images using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on an emotion dataset to classify different emotions, aiding in sentiment analysis and AI-based mood recognition.

🚀 Features

Emotion Classification: Identifies emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.

Deep Learning Model: Uses CNN for accurate recognition.

Data Augmentation: Improves dataset generalization.

Google Colab Integration: Uses Kaggle API for dataset retrieval and cloud training.

User-friendly Interface: Can be extended with Flask/Streamlit for deployment.

💪 Tech Stack

Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL)

Machine Learning: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

Dataset: Kaggle Emotion dataset

Google Colab & Kaggle API for cloud-based training

📊 Dataset

Source: Emotion dataset from Kaggle

Contains labeled facial expressions corresponding to emotions.

Supports multiple emotion categories.

🔄 Model Training Steps

Download Dataset: Uses Kaggle API for fetching data.

Data Preprocessing: Image augmentation and resizing.

Build CNN Model: Using TensorFlow/Keras.

Train & Evaluate: Train the model on processed data.

Deploy (Optional): Use Flask/Streamlit for user input and predictions.

🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Install Dependencies

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib kaggle

2. Setup Kaggle API

Upload kaggle.json and authenticate.

import json
import os
from zipfile import ZipFile

deep = json.load(open("kaggle.json"))

3. Train Model

Run the emotion_detection.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

🎨 Future Enhancements

Deploy as a mobile/web app.

Extend to real-time emotion recognition using a webcam.

Improve accuracy with transfer learning (ResNet, MobileNet, etc.).
